The Game
=======

15-112 Term Project Fall 2013: The Game

The Game is a fun sidescroller. If you don’t have Pygame installed, here’s what you do:

1. Go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
2. Download the latest version for your operating system
3. Install it

Once you’ve done that, open TheGame.py and run it!

Enjoy.
